# Trust-Bounded Systems Glossary (v0.1)

These definitions describe a minimal set of primitives for trust-bounded socio-technical systems.
They are intended to evolve through critique, reuse, and extension.

---

### Trust (State)
A measurable, evolving system variable representing confidence in an actor or component, independent of correctness or intent.

### Trust Continuity
The persistence of trust across system operations unless explicitly degraded or revoked.

### Trust Decay
Reduction of trust over time due to absence of reaffirming evidence or increasing uncertainty.

### Phantom Trust
A condition in which trust persists despite loss of verifiable justification.

### Ghost Credential
A credential that remains operationally effective after the conditions justifying its validity are no longer observable or auditable.

### Boundary-Condition Autonomy
A model in which autonomous action is permitted only within explicit, enforceable, auditable, and revocable system boundaries.

### Auditability
The capacity to reconstruct or explain system behavior post hoc within defined epistemic limits.

### Irrecoverable Audit Loss
A state in which system history cannot be reliably reconstructed due to architectural or policy constraints.

### State Event
An immutable record representing a transition in system state.

### Socio-Technical System
A system in which technical components and human actors jointly influence outcomes and governance.
