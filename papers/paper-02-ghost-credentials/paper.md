# Ghost Credentials and Phantom Trust

## Abstract
Credentialed distributed systems assume trust can be revoked via credential invalidation...

## 1. Contributions
1. Ghost credentials  
2. Phantom trust  
3. Audit loss as structural condition  

## 2. Ghost Credentials
Credentials remain valid after justification is gone...

## 3. Phantom Trust
Trust persists without evidence...

## 4. Irrecoverable Audit Loss
History may be lost due to policy, time, or architecture...

## 5. Design Implications
Separate credential validity from trust justification...

## 6. Related Work
Zero trust constrains access but does not model trust decay...

## 7. Limitations
Identifies failure modes; does not eliminate uncertainty.
