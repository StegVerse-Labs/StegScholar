# StegScholar Roadmap (v0.1)

## Mission
Build a durable scholarly record and publication engine for trust-bounded socio-technical systems:
- papers
- reading maps
- figures/diagrams
- submissions + outcomes
- terminology evolution

---

## Phase 0 — Repo Foundations (Now)
- [x] Establish repo structure
- [x] Versioned glossary (v0.1)
- [x] Papers 1–3 in Markdown
- [x] Submission tracking templates
- [x] Central bibliography file (stegscholar.bib)

Deliverable: “submission-ready pack” for each paper.

---

## Phase 1 — Submit + Iterate (Next 30–90 days)
- [ ] Select 1–2 initial venues per paper
- [ ] Convert Paper 1 and Paper 2 to venue templates
- [ ] Submit Paper 1 to a systems workshop
- [ ] Submit Paper 2 to a security workshop or main-track (depending on readiness)
- [ ] Maintain outcomes.md with review feedback + action plan

Deliverable: first external reviews + revision cycles.

---

## Phase 2 — Field Seeding (90–180 days)
- [ ] Publish glossary artifact as citable preprint/repo release
- [ ] Release shared diagram pack (TikZ + SVG + Markdown specs)
- [ ] Publish “reading map” document: prior work → primitives

Deliverable: terminology adoption + citation hooks.

---

## Phase 3 — Synthesis (after initial acceptances)
- [ ] Capstone paper submission (Survivable Governance)
- [ ] Optional “2-paper combination” spinouts:
  - P1+P2: trust degradation under audit loss
  - P1+P3: revocable autonomy as architectural state
  - P2+P3: revocation without forensics

Deliverable: the field becomes legible as a coherent program.

---

## Quality Gates (always on)
- Terminology consistency checks
- No platform coupling (StegVerse = existence proof only)
- One grounding element per paper (table/vignette/minimal model)
- Explicit limitations and negative results
